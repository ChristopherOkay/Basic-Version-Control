# Project README

## Explain version control:
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time. It allows you to track modifications, revert to previous stages, and work collaboratively.

## Explain difference between git and github:
Git is a distributed version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and offers additional collaboration features.

## List 3 other GitHub alternatives:
1. GitLab
2. Bitbucket
3. SourceForge

## Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull:
`git fetch` retrieves changes from a remote repository without modifying your working directory. `git pull` is a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`, pulling changes and updating your local branch.

## Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it:
Git cherry-pick is used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. 

## Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it:
Git rebase is used to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving or combining commits. The command is:
```bash
git rebase <branch-name>
